# Advent of Code
## What is it?
> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. [reference](https://adventofcode.com/2020/about)
## What's going on here?
Each day of December, a new 2-part puzzle is released. Python is my "native" language so I'll definitely be using it. However, there is a twist. I will also be solving the puzzles in Ruby. I like the idea of doing the same work in multiple different languages. It helps me understand the differences and gives me things to look back at. I suppose it also allows me to publically prove that I've done things with Ruby.
